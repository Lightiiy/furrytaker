## Git WorkFlow
I'm suggesting a basic gitworkflow with
- ONE main branch -> branch with current latests changes that everyone agrees are "finished".
NO CHANGES ARE DONE DIRECTLY TO THIS BRANCH OR I WILL BE ANGY >:(
- MANY feature branches -> branches made for implementation of specific feautres. Any new feature needs to be created via seperate branch.
  Doing so should idiot proof us from adding changes that break the whole project/marking feature we added caused the break
- MANY bug branches -> branches for fixing stuff from new features. Similar to feature branches
