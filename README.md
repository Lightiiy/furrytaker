## Git WorkFlow
I'm suggesting a basic gitworkflow with
- ONE main branch -> branch with current latests changes that everyone agrees are "finished".
- MANY feature branches -> branches made for implementation of specific feautres. Any new feature needs to be created via seperate branch.
- MANY bug branches -> branches for fixing stuff from new features. Similar to feature branches

## TO-DO
#Features
- Major
Improve timing between movement and Ray Casts
Improve relation between movement and Ray Casts 
- Minor
Add random time intervals for frog movement, and random movement distance.
Collectibles are invurnable for a short period of time after dropping from an enemy
Collectibles jump up and bounce a bit after dropping from enemy
Colliders don't respect the sprite animation for some cases (flipX = true) -> Two seperate colliders, one always disabled depending on the flipX flag state


Tools:
- Unity Hub & Editor
- Figma (??)
- Photshop
- Pixel Edit
- SmackStudio for character animation (??)

Resources:
- udemy :)
